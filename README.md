# Learning Innovation Fellows

This is the GitHub page for the Learning Innovation Fellows Program from the [Gala Sustainability Learning Initiative](https://about.learngala.com) and the [Midwest Big Data Hub](https://midwestbigdatahub.org/). When possible, code by students in the program is posted here in the spirit of open collaboration and public engagement. 

## About the fellowship

Student fellows from across the midwest regionâ€™s colleges, vocational schools, and universities work with faculty to create innovative interactive data analysis activities that nest within sustainability science case studies on the [Gala platform](https://www.learngala.com). They design, prototype, and pilot these features in classrooms or professional learning communities within the Midwest Big Data Hub (MBDH) network, part of a four year, $4 million award from the National Science Foundation.
