# [Carbon Cycling Model: Ecological Restoration in Tropical Rainforests]
_[Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)_

## About
For this project, I created an agent-based carbon cycling model that demonstrates the flow of carbon within a rainforest. It leads users through multiple scenarios that teach them how carbon moves through this environment. Users can interact with the model by using sliders to change variables and running simulations to see the effect of changes. The main goal of the model is that it will be able to be used in a classroom setting to help students gain a deeper understanding. Students can also create their own model with the help of a tutorial if they so choose.

## Review
**Currently seeking input on:**
- Readibilty aspect of the model/story option (making sure that the story mode explains directions clearly and users understand what is being asked of them)
